                <p>3.4</p>
                <p>New object controller! Use this before spawn objects while being builders. Buttons as in the level editor! So rebinds for level editor will be working for this too.</p>
                <p>New "html" tag handler;</p>
                <p>Sound of your death D.</p>

                <p>Max size of spawned titans is 5000 instead of 50 now. But ppl without some modification can see only 50 size max (?). I guess.</p>

                <p>Beast and speedies rebalance! Now you will be able to kill beasts and speedies wont spam you by jumping!</p>
                <p>But this is still pretty powerfull titans!</p>
                <p>Left top panel will show you your state, time, alive/dead ppl, spectated id, fps and ping;</p>
                <p>New role - builder! /spawn [object name], for instance - "cuboid", "plane", "sphere", "cylinder",</p>
