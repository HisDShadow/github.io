                <b>v3.5.1</b> <br />
                Fix... <br />
                some ppl was nt be able to load custom map for some reason... so technology of loading was changed, i guess. Now should works. I suppose. <br /> <br />

                <b>v3.5</b> <br />
                You can add your own custom map with your own models into game!<br />
                1) Create folder "CustomMap" into "EM_Data", <br />
                2) Add your *.unity3d file in there, <br />
                3) Use this command while being MC: <br />
                /emcustommap [file name (without .unity3d)] [Prefab name] [float X] [float Y] [float Z] 0 0 0 0 <br />
                0 0 0 0 - is rotation. If you know how to use it, go ahead! <br />
                Also suicide glitch was fixed...<br /> <br />
            </div> 

                <b>v3.4</b> <br />
                New object controller! Use this before spawn objects while being builders. Buttons as in the level editor! So rebinds for level editor will be working for this too.<br />
                New "html" tag handler;<br />
                Sound of your death D.<br />
                Fix respawn glitch. Now you can use specmode and you wont be spawned. Also if you are a titan you wont be spawned as a human(?). <br />
                Max size of spawned titans is 5000 instead of 50 now. But ppl without some modification can see only 50 size max (?). I guess. <br />
                Lots of optimizations for anticrash. If you got any crashes, send me output_log.txt from a special folder that have been created after the game have crashed! <br /> <br />

                <b>v3.0.3</b> <br />
                some fixes; + /despawn command. Stay near the block and type /despawn; Also punk rocks will destroy spawned blocks; <br />
                Beast was rebalanced again! Need some practice D. <br /> <br />

                <b>v3.0.1</b><br />
                some fixes;<br /> <br />

                <b>v3.0</b> <br />
                sounds from everyone! new sounds - audio_gas_from_others, audio_player_footsteps; <br />
                Beast and speedies rebalance! Now you will be able to kill beasts and speedies wont spam you by jumping! <br />
                But this is still pretty powerfull titans! <br />
                Left top panel will show you your state, time, alive/dead ppl, spectated id, fps and ping; <br />
                New role - builder! /spawn [object name], for instance - "cuboid", "plane", "sphere", "cylinder", <br />
                "capsule", "pyramid", "prism", "arc90", "arc180", "torus", "tube" <br /> <br />

                <b>v2.8.5, 2.8.9, 2.9</b> <br />
                sounds; <br /> <br />

                <b>v2.8.5</b> <br />
                You can set custom sounds for hooks and flares shooting! <br />
                For that create a "Sounds" folder into EM_Data folder and put appropriate sounds with names "audio_rope.wav" and "flareshoot.wav" there. <br />
                Clock was added ^^. <br />
                Fix single game. <br />

                Your kd wont be changed by killers with specific name. <br />
                Speedy titans were added! <br />
                So use the old field to set a percent of Speedy among all titans after restart. <br /> <br />

                <b>2.8</b> <br />
                You can set percent of punks that can throw rocks; Enter the percent and press randomRockThr <br />
                You can set crawler-trap now! Enter min time and max time and press randomTrap. <br />

                That is hook DM, it means that you will kill player if you will hook him. <br />

                Also: <br />
                You can enable/disable rock throwing during the game;  <br /> <br />
